            This is a real wallet. You can use it for yourself in order to store
            your ARK or you top it up and gift it to a friend.<br />

            words passphrase. The balance of this wallet is ________________
            ARK. You will need to send some ARK to the address{" "}
            {wallet.address} (e.g. from an exchange) in order to make it show in
            the block explorer.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Never ever give to anybody your passphrase</strong>. Whoever
            has this passphrase can access the ARK contained in this wallet.
